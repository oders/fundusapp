As you already know, you can create either local PouchDBs:

var localDB = new PouchDB('mylocaldb')

or remote PouchDBs:

var remoteDB = new PouchDB('http://localhost:5984/myremotedb')


#####

To perform unidirectional replication, you simply do:

localDB.replicate.to(remoteDB).on('complete', function () {
  // yay, we're done!
}).on('error', function (err) {
  // boo, something went wrong!
});


#####


However, to make things easier for your poor tired fingers, PouchDB has a shortcut API:

localDB.sync(remoteDB);


#####


You can allow PouchDB to automatically handle this error, and retry until the connection is re-established, by using the retry option:

localDB.sync(remoteDB, {
  live: true,
  retry: true
}).on('change', function (change) {
  // yo, something changed!
}).on('paused', function (info) {
  // replication was paused, usually because of a lost connection
}).on('active', function (info) {
  // replication was resumed
}).on('error', function (err) {
  // totally unhandled error (shouldn't happen)
});
